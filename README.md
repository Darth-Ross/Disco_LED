<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a small open source electronics project for a RGB LED controller. 
=======

This is the prototyping branch of the repo, I will mainly use this branch to commit in-progress software functions to the repo. 
This was neccesary as I wanted to able to work on this project on multiple PC's.
