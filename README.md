# Quick description 

This is a design for a IR RGB LEDstrip driver which uses a 24 key RGB remote. It can display 16 predetermined static colours, change brightness, turn off and on again while remembering the last colour and display special functions like for example smooth colour change or colour flashing. 

The repo includes both hardware and software design which you can either use directly or include in your own projects.
